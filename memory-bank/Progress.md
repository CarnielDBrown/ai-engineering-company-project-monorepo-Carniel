# HealthCore Project Progress

## Completed or already present

- The repository contains the HealthCore company context in `CONTEXT.md`.
- The repository template and top-level folder documentation are present.
- Context documents exist for Milestone 1, the public website; Milestone 2, programming fundamentals; and Milestone 3, the talent pipeline tracker.
- The `uis/talent-pipeline-tracker` Next.js application exists with package scripts for development, build, start, and lint.
- The talent pipeline application includes candidate domain types, a candidate list page, candidate detail routing, API helpers, formatting helpers, and the main talent-pipeline component.
- The `packages/shared` package exists with placeholder shared TypeScript types.

## Current work

The repository does not explicitly identify an active implementation task or current development status beyond the existence of the files and application listed above.

**Current work: Not specified.**

## Upcoming authentication phases

The authentication roadmap in [`docs/AUTHENTICATION_SAGA.md`](../docs/AUTHENTICATION_SAGA.md) now sequences two additional syllabus projects after the existing recovery/change phase:

1. **Phase 4 — Error handling:** implemented, validated, and snapshotted at pushed commit `6a8eef0` on `feature/auth-recovery`. API plus analyzer tests: 27 passed with one Starlette deprecation warning; backoffice lint/build and diff check passed. Pandas runtime CSV cases remain unverified because pandas is not importable in the configured terminal interpreter. Source: [ai-eng-error-handling](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/ai-engineering-syllabus/blob/main/content/projects/ai-eng-error-handling/README.md). Plan: [`services/api/ERROR_HANDLING_PLAN.md`](../services/api/ERROR_HANDLING_PLAN.md).
2. **Phase 5 — Building bullet-proof applications:** underway on `feature/bullet-proof-tests`; the API suite and auth utility suite are passing and measured auth coverage is 90.12%. Full evidence and remaining review are recorded in [`TESTING.md`](../TESTING.md). Source: [ai-eng-building-bullet-proof-applications](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/ai-engineering-syllabus/blob/main/content/projects/ai-eng-building-bullet-proof-applications/README.md).

Phase 3 is snapshotted on `feature/auth-recovery` at `2af5061`. Phase 4 is snapshotted and pushed at `6a8eef0`. Phase 5 has started on `feature/bullet-proof-tests`; its plan is [`services/api/PHASE_5_TESTING_PLAN.md`](../services/api/PHASE_5_TESTING_PLAN.md).

## Remaining work for the memory-bank milestone

- Maintain the project brief, technical context, and progress records as the project evolves.
- Record verified milestone deliverables and validation results as they are completed.
- Record active work and remaining acceptance criteria when the repository provides evidence for them.

## Remaining implementation work

The inspected repository does not provide enough evidence to determine which application acceptance criteria or broader HealthCore milestone requirements are complete. Specific remaining implementation work is therefore **Not specified**.

## Scope and evidence note

This progress file records only facts evidenced by `CONTEXT.md`, the repository README files, the milestone context files, and the inspected source tree. It does not assume that the presence of source files means all documented acceptance criteria have been completed.
